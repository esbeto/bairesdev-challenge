# Coding Challenge
Using the attached PSD files for desktop and mobile, create a fluid and responsive layout that looks great on mobile, tablet and desktop browsers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The layout is fluid and responsive
- There should be no webfonts - substitute the fonts in the design with standard fonts where necessary
- There should be no external assets except for CSS and/or JS
- Do not use any libraries or frameworks

## Optional: 
- When a user scrolls past the nav bar (i.e., the section headers including the icons), it should stick to the header and highlight the icon of the currently visible section 

Feel free to add any additional style and flair to the project that you'd like and consider the overall UX.
