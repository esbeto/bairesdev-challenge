                        What’s covered?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The amount of coverage required by law varies from state to state. If you are a cautious person, you might opt for a more expensive policy with better coverage. If you have a lot of assets, experts recommend that you get enough liability coverage to protect them; otherwise, the other party involved in an accident could sue and attempt to collect on those assets.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="tips">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Read the policy</strong>: Carefully examine your auto insurance policy to understand exactly what is covered, and work with your agent and insurance company to make the right adjustments to suit your unique situation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limits</strong>: Pay attention to the limits and deductibles set by the insurance policy. In some cases, there will be a maximum payout, which may not be as high as you’re looking for. Or in others, the deductible could be higher than you’re willing to pay out of pocket in the event of a claim.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes insurance policies will have exclusions, and you’ll end up paying out of pocket for an accident or repair that you thought would be covered.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="tips">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Other drivers don’t have insurance</strong>: If you get into a collision with an uninsured driver, you’ll have to pay for repairs out of your own pocket and sue for damages unless you have the proper auto insurance policy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Car theft</strong>: Basic insurance policies don’t always cover car theft.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Damage from natural accidents</strong>: Some insurers don’t cover collisions with animals, tornados, earthquakes, damage from falling objects, etc., unless you specifically pay for these coverages.

                    <p>
                        Be wary during a claim. Some insurers will push you to use shops in a direct-repair program or use cheaper replacement parts rather than the original equipment manufacturer.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="tips">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Can you choose a service provider?</strong>: Choosing your own mechanic is the best-case scenario, but they aren’t always covered by insurance policies. Check the fine print of the policy to see if the insurer has control over which service providers and parts are used for repairs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>What if the replacement part breaks?</strong>: Find out how the insurer handles faulty repairs and how quickly they will take care of it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Are service providers reputable?</strong>: If the insurer has the authority to pick your mechanic, investigate them. Look for service reviews online from past claims and from former policyholders.

                        The cost of auto insurance is a big factor in most people’s decision about which policy to choose.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="tips">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Premium</strong>: The premium is the monthly , semi-annual or yearly price that you pay for your insurance plan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Deductible</strong>: Deductibles are the amount of money you are required to pay for a claim before your insurance company starts to pay out. The lower your deductible, the higher your premium tends to be.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Coverage factors</strong>: Depending on much coverage you opt for (i.e., the limits), the cost of your insurance will vary. Your past driving record, credit rating, distance you drive and even drivers’ education will all affect how much your policy costs.

                        In addition to basic auto insurance, there are optional coverages available for drivers with different needs.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Collision coverage</strong>: Collision coverage pays for the expenses to repair your car after you’ve been in an accident, whether you’re at fault or not. If you drive an older car that isn’t worth much money, it may not be worth it to pay for collision insurance.

                            <strong>Uninsured motorist protection</strong>: This protects drivers in the event that they get into an accident with a person who isn’t insured but is to blame for the accident or in a hit-and-run. It will cover damages to the car and injury in the event that another driver is unable to pay out.

                            <strong>Comprehensive coverage</strong>: This covers things that could happen to your car not related to an accident that might not be covered by standard insurance, such as weather damage, running into an animal or other factors. It’s a good idea to opt for comprehensive coverage if you can afford it, but it can get costly and might not be worth it if you drive an old or inexpensive car.

                        The day all parents dread is finally upon you; your teenage child is old enough to drive. But before they pop in a mix-tape (those are still a thing, right?) and step on the gas, they need to learn the rules of the road. ConsumerAffairs asked dozens of driving schools across the country for advice to make the process more enjoyable and educational for you and your student driver.

                        As parents, there are many ways we enjoy spending time with our children. Spending dozens, if not hundreds, of hours sitting white- knuckled in the passenger seat while your student driver practices merging onto a major highway isn’t even on the list. Trust us, we understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, newly licensed drivers are about eight times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes in their first six months than more experienced drivers. The takeaway? Experience counts. The Center for Disease Control suggests that increased education programs and parental involvement in instruction are associated with reductions of as many as 40% of fatal and injury crashes among 16-year-olds.

                        Most people (and even some dogs), are pretty excellent drivers with nothing but sunshine and open roads. Inclement weather causes more than 1.5 million reported traffic accidents per year, resulting in 673,000 injuries and 7,400 fatalities.

                        "Before they take their driver’s test, make sure your student drivers have experience in all different types of weather and non-weather conditions,” says Monica Savioz of Edward Savioz DTS Inc. “That includes everything from heavy traffic to rain, ice, snow and extreme heat."

                        Although we’re sure that you’re probably an excellent driver (you would never speed or cut someone off, would you?), and an even better parent, how are you as a teacher? Many driving school instructors have been teaching student drivers for decades, and we all know teenagers are more likely to listen to literally anyone else than take instruction from their parents.

                        "Take a six hour behind-the-wheel course,” says Dave Urbanek of Urbanek’s Driving School. “The skills provided for young drivers will, hopefully, stay with them all of their lives. We still have former students that we come across that say they are always using tidbits of their driver's education in their everyday driving experiences."

                        We don't have to tell you that teens are impressionable; first Rihanna and Ellie Goulding, now every teenage girl has half of her head shaved. While you can't control which fashion trends they embrace, you can influence the way they drive.

                        "Teens are very likely to pick up the habits of their parents,” says J.C. Fawcett of the Defensive Driving School. “A parent should think about. Do I cuss at other drivers while driving? Do I speed? Do I tailgate? The training that comes from students observing their parents is very powerful. If a parent attempts to change their habits only when their teen is learning to drive, it's probably 10 years too late."

                        Teaching someone to drive can be a stressful experience for both student and teacher. When your life flashes in front of you every few minutes, it can be hard to keep your cool. But even though all of your instincts may tell you to raise your voice and grab the wheel, try to relax.

                        "Take this time as an opportunity to learn from one another,” says Monica Savioz of Edward Savioz DTS Inc. “Parents and teens should show restraint and try to restrain from screaming at each other."

                        Finally, teenage drivers can be expensive to insure, but all the time you put into preparing them for the open road can have unexpected benefits.

                    <p>
                        "Ask insurance companies what discounts are available to them to help reduce the high cost of adding a teen driver," said Ryan MacMartin of Affordable Driving School.

                    <p>
                        "Many companies offer discounts for good grades and for completion of an approved driver’s education or defensive driving course," continued Doreen Haughton-James of 123 Drive! Driving Academy. "Some also have their own discount programs. State Farm, for example, has a program called 'Steer Clear' where students receive discounts for logging driving hours and completing a program."

                        Watching your teenage driver get behind the wheel for the first time can be nerve-wracking. But with the proper instruction and lots of practice, they’ll be able to safely navigate the road for decades to come.
